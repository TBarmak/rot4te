    "description": "A new take on Connect 4. On each turn a player must drop a chip and rotate the board 90Â°, in any order that they choose. When the board is rotated, all of the chips fall as if the direction of gravity has changed directions. Win by connecting 4 in a row. This can happen by either dropping a chip or by rotating the board so that the chips fall into a four in a row."
