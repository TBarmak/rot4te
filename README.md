# rot4te
This React-App is a new take on 4 In A Row.

On each turn a player must drop a chip and rotate the board 90Â°, in any order that they choose. When the board is rotated, all of the chips fall as if the direction of gravity has changed. Win by connecting four chips in a row. This can happen by either dropping a chip or by rotating the board so that the chips fall into a four in a row.
